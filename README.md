## 🛡️ Cyber Projects & Labs

Welcome! This repository serves as a **central index** of my hands-on cybersecurity projects, labs, and experiments as I progress through certifications, coursework, and self-directed learning.

Instead of housing all work in one place, this repo acts as a **portfolio hub** — linking out to individual repositories where each project is fully documented. Think of it as a table of contents for my practical cybersecurity experience.

## 🎯 Focus & Learning Direction

Right now, my primary focus is **studying and certification preparation**, but this space will steadily grow as I complete labs and build out full environments.

My interests include:
- Security operations (SOC-style workflows)
- Log collection, analysis, and detection
- Network and system security fundamentals
- Hands-on experimentation with real tools, not just theory

As projects mature, I’ll add deeper writeups, reflections, and lessons learned — the kind of “aha” moments that only come from doing.

## 📂 Projects

### 🔐 SOC Home Lab *(In Progress)*
- Simulated SOC environment focused on log ingestion and analysis  
- Exploring Windows Event Logging, Splunk, and detection workflows  
- Emphasis on understanding *why* alerts fire, not just how  

👉 Repository: **[SOC-Home-Lab](https://github.com/nemo-b/SOC-Home-Lab/tree/main)**

---

### 🧪 Security & Practice Labs *(Planned / Ongoing)*
- Smaller hands-on labs aligned with certification objectives  
- Network security, system administration, and incident response concepts  
- Occasional scripts or tooling to automate or reinforce learning  

👉 Repositories will be linked here as they’re completed

## 🚀 Why This Repository Exists

I created this repo to:

- Track my hands-on learning and growth over time  
- Present a clear, organized portfolio for recruiters and mentors  
- Document projects in a way that’s easy to follow and reproduce  
- Separate **overview** (this repo) from **implementation** (project repos)

This structure keeps things clean, scalable, and easy to navigate.
